### 10-proxy-rotation.ts (v1.10.0, failover updated in v1.11.0)
Connecting through proxies, and giving each instance its own egress IP:

**Single proxy:**
- Configuring one proxy from `MIAW_PROXY`
- Inspecting it with `getProxyInfo()` (credentials masked)

**Multi-instance rotation:**
- Loading a proxy list file with `ProxyRotator.fromFile()`
- Assigning each `instanceId` a **stable** proxy via the deterministic strategy
- Hot-reloading the proxy file
- Why rotation distributes instances across proxies and must never rotate a *live* session's IP

**Failover:**
- Detecting a dead proxy from the `disconnected` event, ignoring `"intentional"`
  (your own `disconnect()`) and requiring several consecutive failures — one
  blip is not a dead proxy
- Dropping it from the pool and re-selecting, without disturbing your other bots
- Applying the replacement to the **same** client with `disconnect()` →
  `setProxy()` → `connect()`. Reusing the client keeps the session, the stores
  and your event handlers; building a second one on the same `instanceId` would
  put two writers on one auth state

**Setup:** `cp examples/proxies.example.txt ./proxies.txt`, then edit it. Validate with
`npx miaw-cli proxy test-all --proxy-file ./proxies.txt` before running.

> ⚠️ SOCKS proxies do not carry media transfers — those fall back to a direct
> connection and reveal your real IP. See [PROXY.md](../docs/PROXY.md).

**Run:** `ts-node examples/10-proxy-rotation.ts [multi|single|failover]`

## Common Commands

All examples support `!help` to see available commands.

## Tips

- Each bot uses its own session ID, so they won't conflict
- Sessions are saved in `./sessions/` directory
- Delete session directory to re-authenticate
- Many commands work in both private chats and groups
- Some features (labels, catalog) require WhatsApp Business account
- Group admin commands require you to be a group admin
