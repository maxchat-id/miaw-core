## [1.12.0] - 2026-09-02

**Baileys 7.0.0-rc14, and the deferred feature backlog cleared.** All additive;
no breaking changes.

### Changed

- **Upgraded `@whiskeysockets/baileys` from `7.0.0-rc13` to `7.0.0-rc14`** (pinned
  exactly, as before). Four substantive upstream commits:
  - WhatsApp Web version `2.3000.1035194821` → `2.3000.1043857760`. Low impact —
    `resolveWAVersion()` already prefers the live version from `web.whatsapp.com`,
    so the bundled constant is only the third-tier fallback — but a fresher
    fallback is still worth having.
  - **`profilePictureUrl` fix.** The privacy `tctoken` now nests under the
    `picture` query node and carries a `t` attribute, matching WA Web. This
    affects `getContactInfo()`, `getProfilePicture()` and `getChatInfo()` when
    the target has profile-picture privacy enabled.
  - New `Browsers.android()` identity (see below).
  - An internal `Long` type import fix.

  No public API changed; miaw-core's whole Baileys surface — including the
  `updateBussinesProfile` typo, `signalRepository.lidMapping`, the hand-built
  `remove-companion-device` node, `messaging-history.set` `lidPnMappings`, the
  `resyncAppState` collection names, and the dispatcher passed into
  `downloadMediaMessage` — is byte-identical between the two releases.

### Added

- **`BrowserPresets`** — `macOS`, `windows`, `ubuntu` and `android` browser
  identities for the `browser` option, which was previously undocumented outside
  its JSDoc. The default is unchanged (`macOS("Chrome")`).
- **View-once receipt.** `BrowserPresets.android()` negotiates the connection as
  an Android client, which is the only way to **receive view-once media** — a web
  session is never sent it. miaw-core already normalizes view-once messages, so
  `message.media.viewOnce` and `downloadMedia()` start working with no further
  change. Baileys marks this identity experimental; prefer a dedicated
  `instanceId` over switching an established session.
- **Group & community administration.** `setGroupAnnounceOnly`,
  `setGroupRestrictInfo`, `setGroupMemberAddMode`, `setGroupJoinApproval`,
  `setGroupEphemeral`, `getGroupJoinRequests`, `approveGroupJoinRequests`,
  `rejectGroupJoinRequests`, and the eight `setCommunity*` /
  `*CommunityJoinRequests` equivalents.
- **Privacy settings.** `getPrivacySettings()` plus `setLastSeenPrivacy`,
  `setOnlinePrivacy`, `setProfilePicturePrivacy`, `setStatusPrivacy`,
  `setReadReceiptsPrivacy`, `setGroupAddPrivacy`, `setMessagesPrivacy`,
  `setCallPrivacy`, `setDefaultDisappearingMode` and `setLinkPreviewsDisabled`.
- **Blocklist.** `blockContact()`, `unblockContact()`, `getBlocklist()`,
  `isBlocked()`.
- **Calls.** A new `call` event carrying a normalized `MiawCall`, plus
  `rejectCall()` and `createCallLink()`. A single call fires the event several
  times as it progresses; `status === "offer"` is the only stage at which
  `rejectCall()` still works.
- **Disappearing messages.** `setChatEphemeral()` for 1:1 chats alongside the
  group and community variants, with an `EphemeralDuration` constant for the four
  durations the WhatsApp UI offers.
- **Group invite cards.** `sendGroupInvite()` sends the rich "join my group" card
  rather than a pasted link. Its payload type is `GroupInviteMessage` — distinct
  from the existing `GroupInviteInfo`, which is the *preview* returned by
  `getGroupInviteInfo()` before joining.
- **Pin-in-chat.** `pinMessage()` / `unpinMessage()`, with a `PinDuration`
  constant. WhatsApp accepts only 24h, 7d and 30d here — a different set from the
  disappearing-message durations.
- **CLI:** `group|community announce|restrict|add-mode|approval|ephemeral`,
  `group|community requests list|approve|reject`, `privacy
  show|set|disappearing|link-previews`, `block list|add|remove`, `call link`,
  `chat ephemeral|pin-message|unpin-message`, and `send group-invite`. All with
  tab completion and `help` topics.
- **`tests/unit/baileys-export-surface.test.ts`** — imports Baileys unmocked and
  asserts every symbol the two import sites destructure still exists. Thirteen
  unit suites replace the module wholesale with hand-written factories, so
  without this a renamed or removed upstream export stays invisible until
  runtime.

### Fixed

- **`sendGroupInvite()` failed for any group without a profile picture.** Baileys
  embeds a thumbnail on the invite card by calling `getProfilePicUrl(groupJid)`
  and does not guard it; WhatsApp answers `item-not-found` for a pictureless
  group, which throws and aborts the whole send. Since most groups have no
  picture, the unguarded path failed more often than it worked. `sendGroupInvite`
  now passes its own guarded hook — Baileys spreads caller options last, so it
  wins — and sends the card without a thumbnail rather than not at all. Found by
  live testing; it is invisible to unit tests because the mock never throws.
- **Omitting a disappearing-message duration silently disabled it.**
  `miaw-cli group ephemeral <jid>` with no duration turned disappearing messages
  **off** for the whole group instead of printing a usage line — `Number("")` is
  `0`, and `0` is a valid duration meaning "off", so the missing argument parsed
  as a successful request to disable. Same for `community ephemeral`,
  `chat ephemeral`, and `privacy disappearing` (which changed an account-wide
  default). Found in review of this release, before any of it shipped.
- **`--force` could swallow the following token.** It was missing from
  `BOOLEAN_FLAGS` in `bin/miaw-cli.ts`, the same class of bug that `--json` hit
  previously.
- **CLI docs gap.** `chat` commands were entirely undocumented in
  [CLI.md](docs/CLI.md) despite shipping in v1.7.0; they now have a section.

### Internal

- `jest.config.js` sets `maxWorkers: 1`. The live-connection suites share a
  single WhatsApp session, and forking one worker per core for a full run is
  memory-hungry; `test:cli` already passed `--runInBand` for the first reason.
- CLI integration teardown moved from `10-business-commands.test.ts` to the new
  `13-privacy-call-commands.test.ts`. Files run in name order and 13 is now the
  last one needing a connection (11 and 12 are deliberately offline), so
  disconnecting at 10 would pull the socket out from under it.
- 597 unit tests (up from 417), 70 CLI router tests (up from 26), 234 CLI
  integration tests across 13 files.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- **Per-instance proxy pins (CLI).** `miaw-cli instance set-proxy <id>` persists a
  proxy assignment to `<session-path>/instances.json`, so
  `miaw-cli --instance-id bot-3 <command>` uses bot-3's proxy with no flags.
  Four sources: a positional URL, `--label <name>` (selects a `label=` entry from
  the proxy file and stores **no credentials**), `--from-env <VAR>`, and
  `--from-file` (materializes the current deterministic selection).
  `instance unset-proxy <id>` removes it.
- `instance ls` gains a Proxy column (masked) and lists instances that are pinned
  but not yet created as `[not created]` — pinning before `instance create` is
  supported, so the pairing itself comes from the final egress IP.
- **`MiawClient.setProxy(proxy)`** — stages a proxy for the **next** `connect()`,
  returning `{ success, proxy, reconnectRequired, error }`. It never touches a
  live socket, validates eagerly, and is refused when the client was constructed
  with a custom `agent`/`fetchAgent`.
- `getProxyInfo()` gains `active` (is the open socket using this config?) and
  `pending` (what it is using instead). The `{ url, protocol }` shape and the
  `null`-for-custom-agent contract are unchanged.
- New exported types `SetProxyResult` and `ProxyInfo`.
- A complete, runnable dead-proxy failover recipe in docs/PROXY.md and
  examples/10-proxy-rotation.ts, reusing a single client.
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_INSTANCE_PROXY.md` — operational notes for the new
  persistent pin store, and `docs/FOLLOW_UPS.md` for deferred findings.

### Behavior changes

- **`ProxyRotator` now defaults to `deterministic`, not `round-robin`.** The docs
  and CLAUDE.md have always said deterministic is the default; only the CLI
  actually applied it. The mismatch was silent and severe: following the docs
  (`new ProxyRotator(urls)` then `next(id)`) gave round-robin, which hands a
  long-lived session a different egress IP on each call — read by WhatsApp as
  account takeover. Code changed rather than docs, so the default fails safe.
  `next()` with no `instanceId` on a defaulted rotator now throws a message
  naming the fix; pass `{ strategy: "round-robin" }` explicitly to restore the
  old behavior. Checked against the sibling `miaw-api`, which constructs with an
  explicit strategy and always calls `next(instanceId)`: unaffected.

### Fixed

- **The CLI silently dropped the proxy.** `instance create`/`connect`/`disconnect`/
  `logout` built clients from `{instanceId, sessionPath}` only, discarding both
  `proxy` and `debug`. Since the client cache key ignored the proxy, REPL
  `connect <id>` cached a proxy-less client that every later command reused —
  traffic went direct with no indication.
- **REPL `use <id>` carried the previous instance's proxy** to the next one: it
  mutated `config.instanceId` in place without re-resolving.
- **Proxy selection ignored the target instance.** `--proxy-file` was resolved once
  per process against the *startup* instance id, so `instance connect bot-3` got
  another instance's egress IP. Resolution is now per target.
- `instance create` called `createClient()` directly, bypassing the cache, so the
  freshly-paired live client was never registered and the next command built a
  second `MiawClient` for the same account.
- An explicit `disconnect()` emitted `disconnected` twice — once as `"unknown"`
  from the `connection.update{close}` that Baileys' `end()` fires, then once as
  `"intentional"`.
- Console-filter reference leak: the filter was acquired only in the constructor
  but released on every `disconnect()`/`logout()`, so a reconnect cycle lost this
  client's reference and repeated cycles un-filtered other live clients' output.
- Proxy transports leaked: `connect()` built fresh agents on every call, auto-
  reconnects included, and never released the old ones.
- `.cli_history` was written 0644 with every line verbatim, so an
  `instance set-proxy` command turned it into a plaintext credential store. Now
  redacted at entry and written 0600.
- **Global boolean flags swallowed the command name.** The arg parser assumed
  every `--flag` took a value, so `miaw-cli --json instance ls` parsed as
  `json="instance"` and failed with "Unknown command: ls" — even though
  `--json` is documented as a global option. Value-less flags (`--json`,
  `--debug`, `--ip`, `--from-file`, `--help`, `--version`) are now recognised
  as booleans in any position.
- **`src/utils/proxy-rotator.ts` contained a literal NUL byte**, which made
  `file(1)` classify the source as binary and caused `grep` to skip it in any
  repo-wide search. Replaced with the equivalent escape sequence; verified
  runtime-identical, so no instance is remapped to a different proxy.
- **Docs: `fetchAgent` is an `http.Agent`, not an undici Dispatcher.** The JSDoc
  and three doc sites claimed otherwise; the PROXY.md "Custom agents" snippet was
  copy-pasteable and would silently break every media upload through the proxy.
  Also corrects the `createProxyAgents` API-table row and two broken anchors.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-07-29

**Proxy files, rotation, and CLI diagnostics** - builds on the v1.3.0 proxy core.
All additive; no breaking changes.

### Added

- **`socks5h://` and `socks4a://` support.** These resolve DNS *at the proxy*;
  plain `socks5://` / `socks4://` resolve locally, so the destination hostname still
  leaks to your DNS resolver even though the connection is tunnelled. Both variants
  were previously rejected as unsupported protocols despite the underlying agent
  supporting them.
- **Proxy list files** - `loadProxyList()` / `loadProxyListSync()` / `parseProxyList()`
  read TXT (one per line, `#`/`;` comments, optional `weight=` and `label=` tokens,
  scheme-less `host:port[:user:pass]` vendor forms) or JSON (array of strings and/or
  objects, or a `{ "proxies": [...] }` wrapper). Format is auto-detected by extension
  then by content. `validateProxyList()` partitions a list; `watchProxyList()` hot-reloads
  a file.
- **`ProxyRotator`** - `round-robin`, `random`, `weighted`, and `deterministic`
  strategies, plus `ProxyRotator.fromFile()`, `setProxies()`, `getStats()`, and `close()`.
  It returns a `ProxyPoolEntry` you pass to `new MiawClient({ proxy })`, so `getProxyInfo()`
  and proxy validation keep working for rotated instances.
- **`maskProxyUrl()`** - exported credential masking; `getProxyInfo()` now uses it.
- **CLI**: `proxy list` (alias `ls`), `proxy test <url>`, `proxy test-all`. These need
  **no WhatsApp connection** - they probe the proxy through the same agent Baileys uses,
  so you can validate a proxy before spending a pairing attempt on it. `proxy test-all`
  exits non-zero if any proxy fails, so it can gate a deploy.
- **CLI global flags**: `--proxy-file <path>`, `--proxy-strategy <strategy>`
  (default `deterministic`; `instance` accepted as an alias). Env fallbacks:
  `MIAW_PROXY`, `MIAW_PROXY_FILE`, `MIAW_PROXY_STRATEGY`.
- **[.env.example](./.env.example)** - documents every `MIAW_*` runtime variable,
  including `MIAW_INSTANCE_ID` and `MIAW_SESSION_PATH`, which the CLI has always
  read but which were never written down anywhere.
- **[docs/DEPLOYMENT_PROXY.md](./docs/DEPLOYMENT_PROXY.md)** - operational notes for
  deploying with proxies: why `instanceId` must be stable across rollouts, treating
  proxy files as secrets, ConfigMap-safe hot reload, egress firewall rules, and the
  sticky-session requirement.
- **[docs/PROXY.md](./docs/PROXY.md)** - dedicated proxy guide covering configuration,
  proxy files, rotation, CLI diagnostics, troubleshooting, security, and provider
  selection. Replaces the internal `docs/PROXY_SUPPORT_PLAN.md`, which is removed.
- 97 new tests (42 loader, 33 rotator, 22 CLI). The CLI proxy tests are the first in
  `tests/integration/cli/` that run without a WhatsApp session.

### Fixed

- **Media uploads through a proxy were broken and always had been** (since v1.3.0).
  `fetchAgent` was set to an undici `ProxyAgent`, but Baileys declares it as an
  `https.Agent` and its Node upload path hands it to `https.request({ agent })`, which
  cannot use a Dispatcher. Every `sendImage`/`sendVideo`/`sendDocument` through a proxy
  failed with "Media upload failed on all hosts". `fetchAgent` is now the same
  `http.Agent` as `wsAgent`. **Uploads are consequently proxied on SOCKS too**, which
  the previous documentation said was impossible.
- **Media downloads were never proxied.** Baileys downloads with
  `fetch(url, { dispatcher })` and never wires a proxy into that path, and
  `downloadMedia()` passed no options — so every download revealed the real IP
  regardless of proxy settings. It now passes an undici Dispatcher explicitly.
  This works for HTTP/HTTPS proxies; SOCKS downloads remain direct because undici
  has no SOCKS transport.
- `proxy test` reported a **407 Proxy Authentication Required as success**. A 407 comes
  from the proxy itself and means the tunnel was refused, so nothing ever reached
  WhatsApp - but the probe counted any HTTP status as reachable. `proxy test-all` would
  therefore green-light a proxy list with wrong credentials, defeating the pre-flight
  check it exists to provide. It now fails with `EPROXYAUTH` and a non-zero exit code.
- Proxy credentials leaked in two places: `MiawClient` interpolated the raw proxy URL,
  password included, into its "Invalid proxy configuration" error (which lands in logs
  and stack traces), and the CLI printed the raw `--proxy` URL to the REPL startup
  banner. Both are masked now.

### Notes

- `--proxy-strategy` defaults to `deterministic` so a given `instanceId` keeps a stable
  egress IP across runs. **Rotation is for distributing instances across proxies, never
  for rotating a live session's IP** - WhatsApp treats a session's source IP as a trust
  signal, and churning it looks like account takeover.
- Deterministic selection uses rendezvous hashing rather than `hash % length`, so adding
  or removing a proxy remaps only the instances that were on it. Under modulo, one edit
  to your proxy file would change the egress IP of every live session at once.
- SOCKS proxies still route media over a direct connection: Node's `fetch()` requires an
  undici dispatcher and undici has no SOCKS transport. `proxy list` and `proxy test`
  report this per proxy. See [docs/PROXY.md](./docs/PROXY.md).

## [1.9.2] - 2026-07-09

**CommonJS-consumer fix** - Let `require()` resolve the package.

### Fixed

- The `exports` map only declared the `import` condition, so CommonJS /
  `require()` resolution (e.g. `ts-node` compiling to CJS) failed with
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. Added a `default` condition pointing at the
  same ESM build; on Node >=22.12 `require(esm)` now resolves it. The package
  stays ESM-only — no separate CJS build was added.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-07-07

**Message receipts** - Observe delivery/read/played status of messages you send.

### Added

- New `message_receipt` event (`MessageReceiptUpdate`) surfaced from Baileys'
  `message-receipt.update`: `{ messageId, chatId, recipientId, type, timestamp, fromMe }`
  where `type` is `'delivery' | 'read' | 'played'` (derived from the receipt
  timestamps). This is the observe half of read-receipts — `markAsRead` sends
  them, `message_receipt` now reports incoming ones.
- Added `docs/DEFERRED_FEATURES.md` tracking the remaining deferred backlog
  (group/community admin, privacy & blocklist, calls, leftover message types).

## [1.9.0] - 2026-07-07

**Communities** - Wrap Baileys' `community*` API (communities are hubs that link
multiple groups). All additive.

### Added

- **Lifecycle**: `createCommunity`, `getCommunityInfo`, `getCommunityParticipants`,
  `getAllCommunities`, `updateCommunityName`, `updateCommunityDescription`,
  `leaveCommunity`.
- **Linking**: `createCommunityGroup` (create a sub-group inside a community),
  `linkGroupToCommunity` / `unlinkGroupFromCommunity`, `getLinkedGroups`.
- **Participants**: `addCommunityMembers` / `removeCommunityMembers` /
  `promoteCommunityMembers` / `demoteCommunityMembers`.
- **Invites**: `getCommunityInviteLink` / `revokeCommunityInvite` /
  `acceptCommunityInvite` / `getCommunityInviteInfo`.
- **CLI**: `community list|info|create|leave|name|description|linked|link|unlink|group|members|invite`.
- New types: `CommunityInfo`, `LinkedGroup`, `CreateCommunityResult`, `CommunityOperationResult`.

### Notes

- Community admin (settings: announce-only/member-add/join-approval/ephemeral,
  and join-request approve/reject) is deferred to a future phase alongside the
  equivalent group-admin work.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-07-07

**Status posting + business extras** - All additive.

### Added

#### Status / Stories

- `postTextStatus(text, recipients?, opts?)` - text status (backgroundColor, font)
- `postImageStatus(image, recipients?, opts?)` / `postVideoStatus(video, ...)` - media status (caption)
- `recipients` sets the audience (`statusJidList`); when omitted it defaults to
  all individual contacts in the store.
- **CLI**: `story text | image | video` (named `story` to avoid the existing
  `status` connection-status command).

#### Business extras (WhatsApp Business)

- `updateBusinessProfile(updates)` - address, `websites[]`, email, description, hours
- `updateCoverPhoto(image)` (returns a cover id) / `removeCoverPhoto(id)`
- `getOrderDetails(orderId, tokenBase64)` - order details (token comes from a
  received order message)
- `addQuickReply({ shortcut, message, keywords? })` / `removeQuickReply(timestamp)`
- **CLI**: `business profile […]` and `business cover set|remove`
  (order details + quick replies are library-only).
- New types: `PostStatusOptions`, `BusinessProfileUpdate` (+ `BusinessHours`/`BusinessHoursDay`), `CoverPhotoResult`, `OrderInfo` (+ `OrderProductInfo`), `QuickReplyInput`.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-07-07

**REPL quoted-argument fix** - Quoted multi-word arguments (e.g. captions) no
longer get split apart in the interactive REPL.

### Fixed

- **REPL command parsing broke quoted multi-word args**: the REPL split raw
  input on whitespace only (`commandInput.split(/\s+/)`), so
  `send image <phone> <path> "Ini ok"` produced two broken tokens (`"Ini` and
  `ok"`) instead of one caption. Added a quote-aware tokenizer (respects
  `"..."` and `'...'`) used for REPL command dispatch. One-shot CLI usage
  (`npx miaw-cli ...`) was unaffected — the shell already handles quoting there.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-07-07

**Outbound message capture** - Messages you send now appear in the message store
and `get messages`.

### Fixed

- **Outbound messages missing from `getChatMessages` / CLI `get messages`**: the
  `messages.upsert` handler dropped every upsert whose type was not `notify`, but
  Baileys tags our own sends — and any message flushed from the offline/reconnect
  backlog — as `append`. The upsert `type` is a live-vs-backlog signal, **not** a
  direction signal (direction is `key.fromMe`). Both `notify` and `append` are now
  processed, so messages you send (via miaw/CLI **or** from your phone / another
  linked device) are stored under the chat and returned by `getChatMessages`
  (shown as "Me" in the CLI `get messages` output). As a side effect, this also
  stops **inbound** messages that arrive in the offline backlog on reconnect from
  being silently dropped.
- Stored messages are now **deduplicated by id** on insert, so a message
  re-delivered via multiple routes (our send echo, reconnect backlog, history
  sync) is stored only once.

### Notes

- Outbound (`fromMe`) messages are **stored but not emitted** on the `message`
  event, so existing bots don't reply to their own sends. The `message` event now
  fires only for newly-stored **inbound** messages. Behavior change: a message you
  send live from your phone previously emitted `message`; it is now stored silently
  (still visible via `getChatMessages` / `get messages`). No new events were added.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-07-07

**Chat management** - Inbox-style automation via `socket.chatModify`. All additive.

### Added

- Chat operations (take a JID or phone number), returning `ChatOperationResult`:
  - `archiveChat` / `unarchiveChat`
  - `pinChat` / `unpinChat`
  - `muteChat(jid, durationMs?)` / `unmuteChat` (default 8h; stored as an absolute
    mute-end timestamp)
  - `markChatRead` / `markChatUnread` (whole-chat; distinct from per-message
    `markAsRead`)
  - `clearChat` / `deleteChat`
- Message operations: `starMessage(message)` / `unstarMessage(message)`.
- **CLI**: `chat archive|unarchive|pin|unpin|mute|unmute|read|unread|clear|delete <jid|phone>`.
- New `ChatOperationResult` type; `isMuted?` added to `ChatInfo`.

### Notes

- `archive` / `clear` / `delete` / `markChatRead` require the chat's last message
  (`lastMessages`), pulled from the in-memory message store — less reliable for a
  chat with no synced/received messages yet.
- `star` / `unstar` are library-only (they operate on a message object, not a JID).

## [1.6.1] - 2026-07-07

**Fresh-login fix + connection hardening** - Restores QR/pairing registration
after WhatsApp's ~2026-06-29 server-side change, and makes connection failures
fast and honest instead of a silent 120s timeout.

### Fixed

- **Fresh registration rejected with 428 (no QR)**: WhatsApp now rejects the
  legacy "Desktop" client identity (`webSubPlatform` DARWIN/WIN32) during
  registration. The default browser tuple changed from
  `Browsers.macOS("Desktop")` to `Browsers.macOS("Chrome")`, which still pairs.
  Already-paired sessions reconnect without re-pairing. Note: the linked device
  now shows as "Chrome (Mac OS)" on the phone, and history sync may be
  shallower than the old Desktop identity delivered.
  ([Baileys #2671](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys/issues/2671),
  [#2677](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys/issues/2677))
- **CLI hid connection failures**: a connection closed before QR/ready now
  surfaces immediately (e.g. `Connection closed (428: connectionClosed)`)
  instead of blocking for the full 120s connection timeout and reporting a
  misleading `state: connecting`.
- **Reconnect storm**: reconnection now uses exponential backoff
  (3s → 6s → … capped at 60s) instead of a flat 3s, and never-registered
  sessions stop after 5 attempts with an `error` event — previously a
  persistent pre-QR rejection fired ~40 registration attempts per 2 minutes
  and risked rate-limiting the IP.
- **Stale WA version**: version resolution now prefers the real current
  WhatsApp Web version (`fetchLatestWaWebVersion`) with fallback to
  `fetchLatestBaileysVersion` and the bundled default, guarded by an 8s
  timeout and cached across reconnects.

### Added

- New `browser` option on `MiawClientOptions` (`[os, browserName, version]`)
  to override the client identity tuple without a library release.
- `disconnected` event now carries the Baileys `DisconnectReason` status code
  as a second argument: `(reason?: string, statusCode?: number)`.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-27

**Rich messages + pairing-code auth** - The standard message types every
comparable WhatsApp library ships, plus QR-free authentication. All additive.

### Added

- **Rich message types** (thin `sendMessage` wrappers):
  - `sendLocation(to, latitude, longitude, opts?)` - share a location
  - `sendContact(to, contacts, opts?)` - share contact card(s) as vCards
    (single object or array)
  - `sendSticker(to, sticker, opts?)` - send a WebP sticker
  - `sendPoll(to, name, options, opts?)` - send a poll (selectableCount, ≥2 options)
  - `mentions` option on `sendText` / `sendImage` / `sendVideo` (group @mentions)
- **Poll-vote reading** - a `messages.update` handler decodes incoming votes
  (`getAggregateVotesInPollMessage`) and emits a new `poll_vote` event with the
  aggregated tally.
- **Pairing-code authentication** - new `usePairingCode` + `phoneNumber` options;
  on a fresh session miaw requests an 8-char code and emits the new
  `pairing_code` event (QR suppressed). Headless/server friendly.
- **CLI**: `send location | contact | poll | sticker` subcommands.
- New types: `ContactCard`, `SendLocationOptions`, `SendContactOptions`,
  `SendStickerOptions`, `SendPollOptions`, `PollVoteUpdate`; new events
  `poll_vote` and `pairing_code`.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-26

**Native LID management** - Adopt Baileys 7.0.0-rc13's native LID infrastructure
(`signalRepository.lidMapping`) as a resolution layer behind the existing LRU
cache. Fully additive — synchronous `resolveLidToJid` / `getPhoneFromJid` are
unchanged.

### Added

- `resolveLidToJidAsync()` / `getPhoneFromJidAsync()` - async LID resolution that
  consults Baileys' native LID store (`getPNForLID`, server/USync-backed) on a
  local cache miss and back-fills the cache.
- `resolveLidsToPhones(lids)` - bulk resolution: cache hits served locally, the
  remaining misses sent in a single `getPNsForLIDs` query.
- `getLidForPhone(phone)` - reverse resolution (phone number → LID) via
  `getLIDForPN`, seeding the local cache.
- Inbound `messages.upsert` now falls back to the native store when a sender's
  `@lid` is not yet cached, improving `senderPhone` resolution.
- `LidMapping` type exported for typing native LID mappings / `lidPnMappings`.

### Changed

- JIDs returned by the native store (which are device-specific, e.g.
  `6281234567890:0@s.whatsapp.net`) are normalized via `jidNormalizedUser`
  before caching, so `message.from` and `messagesStore` keys stay consistent
  with every other resolution path.

- History sync now ingests the dedicated `lidPnMappings` array Baileys provides
  on `messaging-history.set` (previously ignored) as a high-confidence source.
- `makeWASocket` sets `enableAutoSessionRecreation: true` explicitly (already the
  rc13 default) to document reliance on Baileys' automatic PN↔LID session
  migration; no behavior change.

### Notes

- `signalRepository.migrateSession` is intentionally **not** wrapped — Baileys
  already calls it internally on message decode, so a manual method would be
  redundant.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-06-26

**Baileys upgrade** - Move to the latest Baileys release (7.0.0-rc13).

### Changed

- Upgraded `@whiskeysockets/baileys` from `7.0.0-rc.9` to `7.0.0-rc13` (pinned
  exactly). Picks up security fixes (GHSA-qvv5-jq5g-4cgg, a protocolMessage parse
  regression), performance/stability work, and libsignal published to the npm
  registry. No public API changes.

### Fixed

- LID->phone resolution now reads `Contact.phoneNumber` / `Chat.pnJid` for
  LID-keyed entries. Baileys rc10 removed the `Contact.jid` field, which the
  mapping builders still relied on, so mappings derived from contacts/chats were
  silently dropped.
- Message LID->phone resolution now uses the rc13 message-key alt fields
  (`remoteJidAlt` / `participantAlt` / `addressingMode`). rc13 no longer sets
  `senderPn` / `participantPn` / `senderLid` on keys, so for privacy/LID accounts
  the per-message mapping never fired and `senderPhone` came back empty. Applied
  on both the live (`messages.upsert`) and history-sync paths, and in
  `MessageHandler.normalize`.
- `BaileysMessage.message` is now typed `... | null` to match Baileys (which
  emits `null` messages for protocol/placeholder entries).
- Repaired pre-existing unit/integration test fixtures that no longer compiled
  under strict typing (missing message `type`, incomplete `createProduct` input).
- `05-media-send` integration suite used `__dirname`, which is undefined under the
  ESM/ts-jest setup, so the suite failed to run. Derived it from `import.meta.url`.

### Verified

- Live integration run against Baileys rc13: messaging, media send/download,
  contacts, groups, presence, business, profile, and inbound `senderPhone`
  resolution (including the rc13 alt-field path) confirmed working. Unit suite
  113/113. Known live-only gaps: newsletter create id (upstream), and tests that
  require an inbound message / second party.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-13

**Proxy support** - route a WhatsApp connection through a proxy, per instance.

_Backfilled: this release shipped in commit `8def495` but was never recorded here._

### Added

- `proxy` option on `MiawClientOptions`, accepting a URL string or a `ProxyConfig`
  object (`{ url, username?, password? }`). Supports HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5.
- `createProxyAgents()` and `validateProxyConfig()` in `src/utils/proxy-agent.ts`.
  Dual-agent approach: `https-proxy-agent` / `socks-proxy-agent` for the WebSocket
  transport, `undici`'s `ProxyAgent` for media upload/download.
- `agent` and `fetchAgent` escape-hatch options for supplying custom transports.
- `MiawClient.getProxyInfo()` for inspecting the active proxy.
- `--proxy <url>` CLI flag.

### Notes

- SOCKS proxies tunnel the WebSocket but not media transfers: Node's `fetch()` needs an
  undici dispatcher and undici has no SOCKS transport, so media falls back to a direct
  connection.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-20

**Code quality release** - configurable timeouts, validation utilities, and type safety.

_Backfilled: this release shipped in commit `2e922d2` but was never recorded here._

### Added

- Configurable timeouts and exported `TIMEOUTS` / `THRESHOLDS` constants.
- Validation utilities and type-guard helpers (`isError`, `getErrorMessage`,
  `isBaileysMessage`, `isBaileysMessageUpsert`).
- Custom logger support.
- CLI: `send video`, `send audio`, `media download`; topic-specific help sub-commands
  and expanded autocomplete.

### Changed

- Type-safety improvements throughout; 14 of 15 issues from the code review report
  resolved. No breaking changes.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-02

**Baileys v7 Migration** - ESM-only release with improved session stability

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **ESM-only** - Package now uses `"type": "module"`. CommonJS `require()` is no longer supported.
- **Node.js >= 18.0.0** required

### Fixed

- **Session reconnection issue** - Fixed bug where app couldn't reconnect after QR scan and restart without re-pairing
- Includes fixes from Baileys v7: #1735, #1822, #1663, #1697

### Changed

- **Baileys** upgraded from v6.7.21 to v7.0.0-rc.9
- TypeScript target updated to ES2022
- All imports now use `.js` extensions for ESM compatibility
- Node.js built-in imports use `node:` prefix

### Migration

For users upgrading from v1.0.x:

```typescript
// No code changes needed if already using ESM imports
import { MiawClient } from "miaw-core";

// If using CommonJS, migrate to ESM:
// Before (CommonJS - no longer supported):
// const { MiawClient } = require('miaw-core');

// After (ESM):
import { MiawClient } from "miaw-core";
```

Ensure your `package.json` has `"type": "module"` or use `.mjs` file extension.
