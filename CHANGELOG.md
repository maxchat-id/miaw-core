# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.10.0] - 2026-07-29

**Proxy files, rotation, and CLI diagnostics** - builds on the v1.3.0 proxy core.
All additive; no breaking changes.

### Added

- **Proxy list files** - `loadProxyList()` / `loadProxyListSync()` / `parseProxyList()`
  read TXT (one per line, `#`/`;` comments, optional `weight=` and `label=` tokens,
  scheme-less `host:port[:user:pass]` vendor forms) or JSON (array of strings and/or
  objects, or a `{ "proxies": [...] }` wrapper). Format is auto-detected by extension
  then by content. `validateProxyList()` partitions a list; `watchProxyList()` hot-reloads
  a file.
- **`ProxyRotator`** - `round-robin`, `random`, `weighted`, and `deterministic`
  strategies, plus `ProxyRotator.fromFile()`, `setProxies()`, `getStats()`, and `close()`.
  It returns a `ProxyPoolEntry` you pass to `new MiawClient({ proxy })`, so `getProxyInfo()`
  and proxy validation keep working for rotated instances.
- **`maskProxyUrl()`** - exported credential masking; `getProxyInfo()` now uses it.
- **CLI**: `proxy list` (alias `ls`), `proxy test <url>`, `proxy test-all`. These need
  **no WhatsApp connection** - they probe the proxy through the same agent Baileys uses,
  so you can validate a proxy before spending a pairing attempt on it. `proxy test-all`
  exits non-zero if any proxy fails, so it can gate a deploy.
- **CLI global flags**: `--proxy-file <path>`, `--proxy-strategy <strategy>`
  (default `deterministic`; `instance` accepted as an alias). Env fallbacks:
  `MIAW_PROXY`, `MIAW_PROXY_FILE`, `MIAW_PROXY_STRATEGY`.
- **[docs/PROXY.md](./docs/PROXY.md)** - dedicated proxy guide covering configuration,
  proxy files, rotation, CLI diagnostics, troubleshooting, security, and provider
  selection. Replaces the internal `docs/PROXY_SUPPORT_PLAN.md`, which is removed.
- 97 new tests (42 loader, 33 rotator, 22 CLI). The CLI proxy tests are the first in
  `tests/integration/cli/` that run without a WhatsApp session.

### Fixed

- Proxy credentials leaked in two places: `MiawClient` interpolated the raw proxy URL,
  password included, into its "Invalid proxy configuration" error (which lands in logs
  and stack traces), and the CLI printed the raw `--proxy` URL to the REPL startup
  banner. Both are masked now.

### Notes

- `--proxy-strategy` defaults to `deterministic` so a given `instanceId` keeps a stable
  egress IP across runs. **Rotation is for distributing instances across proxies, never
  for rotating a live session's IP** - WhatsApp treats a session's source IP as a trust
  signal, and churning it looks like account takeover.
- Deterministic selection uses rendezvous hashing rather than `hash % length`, so adding
  or removing a proxy remaps only the instances that were on it. Under modulo, one edit
  to your proxy file would change the egress IP of every live session at once.
- SOCKS proxies still route media over a direct connection: Node's `fetch()` requires an
  undici dispatcher and undici has no SOCKS transport. `proxy list` and `proxy test`
  report this per proxy. See [docs/PROXY.md](./docs/PROXY.md).

## [1.9.1] - 2026-07-07

**Message receipts** - Observe delivery/read/played status of messages you send.

### Added

- New `message_receipt` event (`MessageReceiptUpdate`) surfaced from Baileys'
  `message-receipt.update`: `{ messageId, chatId, recipientId, type, timestamp, fromMe }`
  where `type` is `'delivery' | 'read' | 'played'` (derived from the receipt
  timestamps). This is the observe half of read-receipts — `markAsRead` sends
  them, `message_receipt` now reports incoming ones.
- Added `docs/DEFERRED_FEATURES.md` tracking the remaining deferred backlog
  (group/community admin, privacy & blocklist, calls, leftover message types).

## [1.9.0] - 2026-07-07

**Communities** - Wrap Baileys' `community*` API (communities are hubs that link
multiple groups). All additive.

### Added

- **Lifecycle**: `createCommunity`, `getCommunityInfo`, `getCommunityParticipants`,
  `getAllCommunities`, `updateCommunityName`, `updateCommunityDescription`,
  `leaveCommunity`.
- **Linking**: `createCommunityGroup` (create a sub-group inside a community),
  `linkGroupToCommunity` / `unlinkGroupFromCommunity`, `getLinkedGroups`.
- **Participants**: `addCommunityMembers` / `removeCommunityMembers` /
  `promoteCommunityMembers` / `demoteCommunityMembers`.
- **Invites**: `getCommunityInviteLink` / `revokeCommunityInvite` /
  `acceptCommunityInvite` / `getCommunityInviteInfo`.
- **CLI**: `community list|info|create|leave|name|description|linked|link|unlink|group|members|invite`.
- New types: `CommunityInfo`, `LinkedGroup`, `CreateCommunityResult`, `CommunityOperationResult`.

### Notes

- Community admin (settings: announce-only/member-add/join-approval/ephemeral,
  and join-request approve/reject) is deferred to a future phase alongside the
  equivalent group-admin work.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-07-07

**Status posting + business extras** - All additive.

### Added

#### Status / Stories

- `postTextStatus(text, recipients?, opts?)` - text status (backgroundColor, font)
- `postImageStatus(image, recipients?, opts?)` / `postVideoStatus(video, ...)` - media status (caption)
- `recipients` sets the audience (`statusJidList`); when omitted it defaults to
  all individual contacts in the store.
- **CLI**: `story text | image | video` (named `story` to avoid the existing
  `status` connection-status command).

#### Business extras (WhatsApp Business)

- `updateBusinessProfile(updates)` - address, `websites[]`, email, description, hours
- `updateCoverPhoto(image)` (returns a cover id) / `removeCoverPhoto(id)`
- `getOrderDetails(orderId, tokenBase64)` - order details (token comes from a
  received order message)
- `addQuickReply({ shortcut, message, keywords? })` / `removeQuickReply(timestamp)`
- **CLI**: `business profile […]` and `business cover set|remove`
  (order details + quick replies are library-only).
- New types: `PostStatusOptions`, `BusinessProfileUpdate` (+ `BusinessHours`/`BusinessHoursDay`), `CoverPhotoResult`, `OrderInfo` (+ `OrderProductInfo`), `QuickReplyInput`.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-07-07

**REPL quoted-argument fix** - Quoted multi-word arguments (e.g. captions) no
longer get split apart in the interactive REPL.

### Fixed

- **REPL command parsing broke quoted multi-word args**: the REPL split raw
  input on whitespace only (`commandInput.split(/\s+/)`), so
  `send image <phone> <path> "Ini ok"` produced two broken tokens (`"Ini` and
  `ok"`) instead of one caption. Added a quote-aware tokenizer (respects
  `"..."` and `'...'`) used for REPL command dispatch. One-shot CLI usage
  (`npx miaw-cli ...`) was unaffected — the shell already handles quoting there.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-07-07

**Outbound message capture** - Messages you send now appear in the message store
and `get messages`.

### Fixed

- **Outbound messages missing from `getChatMessages` / CLI `get messages`**: the
  `messages.upsert` handler dropped every upsert whose type was not `notify`, but
  Baileys tags our own sends — and any message flushed from the offline/reconnect
  backlog — as `append`. The upsert `type` is a live-vs-backlog signal, **not** a
  direction signal (direction is `key.fromMe`). Both `notify` and `append` are now
  processed, so messages you send (via miaw/CLI **or** from your phone / another
  linked device) are stored under the chat and returned by `getChatMessages`
  (shown as "Me" in the CLI `get messages` output). As a side effect, this also
  stops **inbound** messages that arrive in the offline backlog on reconnect from
  being silently dropped.
- Stored messages are now **deduplicated by id** on insert, so a message
  re-delivered via multiple routes (our send echo, reconnect backlog, history
  sync) is stored only once.

### Notes

- Outbound (`fromMe`) messages are **stored but not emitted** on the `message`
  event, so existing bots don't reply to their own sends. The `message` event now
  fires only for newly-stored **inbound** messages. Behavior change: a message you
  send live from your phone previously emitted `message`; it is now stored silently
  (still visible via `getChatMessages` / `get messages`). No new events were added.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-07-07

**Chat management** - Inbox-style automation via `socket.chatModify`. All additive.

### Added

- Chat operations (take a JID or phone number), returning `ChatOperationResult`:
  - `archiveChat` / `unarchiveChat`
  - `pinChat` / `unpinChat`
  - `muteChat(jid, durationMs?)` / `unmuteChat` (default 8h; stored as an absolute
    mute-end timestamp)
  - `markChatRead` / `markChatUnread` (whole-chat; distinct from per-message
    `markAsRead`)
  - `clearChat` / `deleteChat`
- Message operations: `starMessage(message)` / `unstarMessage(message)`.
- **CLI**: `chat archive|unarchive|pin|unpin|mute|unmute|read|unread|clear|delete <jid|phone>`.
- New `ChatOperationResult` type; `isMuted?` added to `ChatInfo`.

### Notes

- `archive` / `clear` / `delete` / `markChatRead` require the chat's last message
  (`lastMessages`), pulled from the in-memory message store — less reliable for a
  chat with no synced/received messages yet.
- `star` / `unstar` are library-only (they operate on a message object, not a JID).

## [1.6.1] - 2026-07-07

**Fresh-login fix + connection hardening** - Restores QR/pairing registration
after WhatsApp's ~2026-06-29 server-side change, and makes connection failures
fast and honest instead of a silent 120s timeout.

### Fixed

- **Fresh registration rejected with 428 (no QR)**: WhatsApp now rejects the
  legacy "Desktop" client identity (`webSubPlatform` DARWIN/WIN32) during
  registration. The default browser tuple changed from
  `Browsers.macOS("Desktop")` to `Browsers.macOS("Chrome")`, which still pairs.
  Already-paired sessions reconnect without re-pairing. Note: the linked device
  now shows as "Chrome (Mac OS)" on the phone, and history sync may be
  shallower than the old Desktop identity delivered.
  ([Baileys #2671](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys/issues/2671),
  [#2677](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys/issues/2677))
- **CLI hid connection failures**: a connection closed before QR/ready now
  surfaces immediately (e.g. `Connection closed (428: connectionClosed)`)
  instead of blocking for the full 120s connection timeout and reporting a
  misleading `state: connecting`.
- **Reconnect storm**: reconnection now uses exponential backoff
  (3s → 6s → … capped at 60s) instead of a flat 3s, and never-registered
  sessions stop after 5 attempts with an `error` event — previously a
  persistent pre-QR rejection fired ~40 registration attempts per 2 minutes
  and risked rate-limiting the IP.
- **Stale WA version**: version resolution now prefers the real current
  WhatsApp Web version (`fetchLatestWaWebVersion`) with fallback to
  `fetchLatestBaileysVersion` and the bundled default, guarded by an 8s
  timeout and cached across reconnects.

### Added

- New `browser` option on `MiawClientOptions` (`[os, browserName, version]`)
  to override the client identity tuple without a library release.
- `disconnected` event now carries the Baileys `DisconnectReason` status code
  as a second argument: `(reason?: string, statusCode?: number)`.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-27

**Rich messages + pairing-code auth** - The standard message types every
comparable WhatsApp library ships, plus QR-free authentication. All additive.

### Added

- **Rich message types** (thin `sendMessage` wrappers):
  - `sendLocation(to, latitude, longitude, opts?)` - share a location
  - `sendContact(to, contacts, opts?)` - share contact card(s) as vCards
    (single object or array)
  - `sendSticker(to, sticker, opts?)` - send a WebP sticker
  - `sendPoll(to, name, options, opts?)` - send a poll (selectableCount, ≥2 options)
  - `mentions` option on `sendText` / `sendImage` / `sendVideo` (group @mentions)
- **Poll-vote reading** - a `messages.update` handler decodes incoming votes
  (`getAggregateVotesInPollMessage`) and emits a new `poll_vote` event with the
  aggregated tally.
- **Pairing-code authentication** - new `usePairingCode` + `phoneNumber` options;
  on a fresh session miaw requests an 8-char code and emits the new
  `pairing_code` event (QR suppressed). Headless/server friendly.
- **CLI**: `send location | contact | poll | sticker` subcommands.
- New types: `ContactCard`, `SendLocationOptions`, `SendContactOptions`,
  `SendStickerOptions`, `SendPollOptions`, `PollVoteUpdate`; new events
  `poll_vote` and `pairing_code`.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-26

**Native LID management** - Adopt Baileys 7.0.0-rc13's native LID infrastructure
(`signalRepository.lidMapping`) as a resolution layer behind the existing LRU
cache. Fully additive — synchronous `resolveLidToJid` / `getPhoneFromJid` are
unchanged.

### Added

- `resolveLidToJidAsync()` / `getPhoneFromJidAsync()` - async LID resolution that
  consults Baileys' native LID store (`getPNForLID`, server/USync-backed) on a
  local cache miss and back-fills the cache.
- `resolveLidsToPhones(lids)` - bulk resolution: cache hits served locally, the
  remaining misses sent in a single `getPNsForLIDs` query.
- `getLidForPhone(phone)` - reverse resolution (phone number → LID) via
  `getLIDForPN`, seeding the local cache.
- Inbound `messages.upsert` now falls back to the native store when a sender's
  `@lid` is not yet cached, improving `senderPhone` resolution.
- `LidMapping` type exported for typing native LID mappings / `lidPnMappings`.

### Changed

- JIDs returned by the native store (which are device-specific, e.g.
  `6281234567890:0@s.whatsapp.net`) are normalized via `jidNormalizedUser`
  before caching, so `message.from` and `messagesStore` keys stay consistent
  with every other resolution path.

- History sync now ingests the dedicated `lidPnMappings` array Baileys provides
  on `messaging-history.set` (previously ignored) as a high-confidence source.
- `makeWASocket` sets `enableAutoSessionRecreation: true` explicitly (already the
  rc13 default) to document reliance on Baileys' automatic PN↔LID session
  migration; no behavior change.

### Notes

- `signalRepository.migrateSession` is intentionally **not** wrapped — Baileys
  already calls it internally on message decode, so a manual method would be
  redundant.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-06-26

**Baileys upgrade** - Move to the latest Baileys release (7.0.0-rc13).

### Changed

- Upgraded `@whiskeysockets/baileys` from `7.0.0-rc.9` to `7.0.0-rc13` (pinned
  exactly). Picks up security fixes (GHSA-qvv5-jq5g-4cgg, a protocolMessage parse
  regression), performance/stability work, and libsignal published to the npm
  registry. No public API changes.

### Fixed

- LID->phone resolution now reads `Contact.phoneNumber` / `Chat.pnJid` for
  LID-keyed entries. Baileys rc10 removed the `Contact.jid` field, which the
  mapping builders still relied on, so mappings derived from contacts/chats were
  silently dropped.
- Message LID->phone resolution now uses the rc13 message-key alt fields
  (`remoteJidAlt` / `participantAlt` / `addressingMode`). rc13 no longer sets
  `senderPn` / `participantPn` / `senderLid` on keys, so for privacy/LID accounts
  the per-message mapping never fired and `senderPhone` came back empty. Applied
  on both the live (`messages.upsert`) and history-sync paths, and in
  `MessageHandler.normalize`.
- `BaileysMessage.message` is now typed `... | null` to match Baileys (which
  emits `null` messages for protocol/placeholder entries).
- Repaired pre-existing unit/integration test fixtures that no longer compiled
  under strict typing (missing message `type`, incomplete `createProduct` input).
- `05-media-send` integration suite used `__dirname`, which is undefined under the
  ESM/ts-jest setup, so the suite failed to run. Derived it from `import.meta.url`.

### Verified

- Live integration run against Baileys rc13: messaging, media send/download,
  contacts, groups, presence, business, profile, and inbound `senderPhone`
  resolution (including the rc13 alt-field path) confirmed working. Unit suite
  113/113. Known live-only gaps: newsletter create id (upstream), and tests that
  require an inbound message / second party.

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-13

**Proxy support** - route a WhatsApp connection through a proxy, per instance.

_Backfilled: this release shipped in commit `8def495` but was never recorded here._

### Added

- `proxy` option on `MiawClientOptions`, accepting a URL string or a `ProxyConfig`
  object (`{ url, username?, password? }`). Supports HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5.
- `createProxyAgents()` and `validateProxyConfig()` in `src/utils/proxy-agent.ts`.
  Dual-agent approach: `https-proxy-agent` / `socks-proxy-agent` for the WebSocket
  transport, `undici`'s `ProxyAgent` for media upload/download.
- `agent` and `fetchAgent` escape-hatch options for supplying custom transports.
- `MiawClient.getProxyInfo()` for inspecting the active proxy.
- `--proxy <url>` CLI flag.

### Notes

- SOCKS proxies tunnel the WebSocket but not media transfers: Node's `fetch()` needs an
  undici dispatcher and undici has no SOCKS transport, so media falls back to a direct
  connection.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-20

**Code quality release** - configurable timeouts, validation utilities, and type safety.

_Backfilled: this release shipped in commit `2e922d2` but was never recorded here._

### Added

- Configurable timeouts and exported `TIMEOUTS` / `THRESHOLDS` constants.
- Validation utilities and type-guard helpers (`isError`, `getErrorMessage`,
  `isBaileysMessage`, `isBaileysMessageUpsert`).
- Custom logger support.
- CLI: `send video`, `send audio`, `media download`; topic-specific help sub-commands
  and expanded autocomplete.

### Changed

- Type-safety improvements throughout; 14 of 15 issues from the code review report
  resolved. No breaking changes.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-02

**Baileys v7 Migration** - ESM-only release with improved session stability

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **ESM-only** - Package now uses `"type": "module"`. CommonJS `require()` is no longer supported.
- **Node.js >= 18.0.0** required

### Fixed

- **Session reconnection issue** - Fixed bug where app couldn't reconnect after QR scan and restart without re-pairing
- Includes fixes from Baileys v7: #1735, #1822, #1663, #1697

### Changed

- **Baileys** upgraded from v6.7.21 to v7.0.0-rc.9
- TypeScript target updated to ES2022
- All imports now use `.js` extensions for ESM compatibility
- Node.js built-in imports use `node:` prefix

### Migration

For users upgrading from v1.0.x:

```typescript
// No code changes needed if already using ESM imports
import { MiawClient } from "miaw-core";

// If using CommonJS, migrate to ESM:
// Before (CommonJS - no longer supported):
// const { MiawClient } = require('miaw-core');

// After (ESM):
import { MiawClient } from "miaw-core";
```

Ensure your `package.json` has `"type": "module"` or use `.mjs` file extension.
